# Enhanced Fake News Detection with Fuzzy Deep Learning and LSTM

This project introduces an advanced fake news detection system using fuzzy deep learning techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The proposed model effectively addresses the uncertainty in fake news classification by capturing long-range dependencies in textual data, achieving high accuracy.

## Features
- **LSTM-based Model**: Utilizes the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture long-range dependencies in text data, enhancing fake news detection.
- **Fuzzy Deep Learning Approach**: Incorporates fuzzy logic to handle the inherent uncertainty in fake news detection, improving classification performance.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves impressive detection accuracy, making it an effective solution for identifying fake news in a variety of text sources.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for model development and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training the LSTM model.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques used for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction.
